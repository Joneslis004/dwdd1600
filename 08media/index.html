         <h1>Interior Design History</h1>
         <h2>In the Beginning</h2>
        <p>In the past, <em>interiors were put together instinctively</em> as a part of the process of building.The profession of interior design has been a consequence of the development of society and the complex architecture that has resulted from the development of industrial processes.The pursuit of effective use of space, user well-being and functional design has contributed to the development of the contemporary interior design profession. The profession of interior design is separate and distinct from the role of interior decorator, a term commonly used in the US; the term is less common in the UK, where the profession of interior design is still unregulated and therefore, strictly speaking, not yet officially a profession.In ancient India, architects would also function as interior designers. This can be seen from the references of <strong>Vishwakarma</strong> the architect—one of the gods in Indian mythology. In these architects' design of 17th-century Indian homes, sculptures depicting ancient texts and events are seen inside the palaces, while during the medieval times wall art paintings were a common feature of palace-like mansions in India commonly known as havelis. While most traditional homes have been demolished to make way to modern buildings, there are still around 2000 havel is in the Shekhawati region of Rajashtan that display wall art paintings.</p>

        <h2>Commercial Interior Design</h2>
        <p>In the mid-to-late 19th century, interior design services expanded greatly, as the middle class in industrial countries grew in size and prosperity and began to desire the domestic trappings of wealth to cement their new status. Large furniture firms began to branch out into general interior design and management, offering full house furnishings in a variety of styles. This business model flourished from the mid-century to 1914, when this role was increasingly usurped by independent, often amateur, designers. This paved the way for the emergence of the professional interior design in the mid-20th century.</p>

        <p>By the turn of the 20th century, amateur advisors and publications were increasingly challenging the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly#:~:text=A%20monopoly%20(from%20Greek%20%CE%BC%CF%8C%CE%BD%CE%BF%CF%82,%20m%C3%B3nos," target="_blank" rel="nofollow">monopoly</a> that the large retail companies had on interior design.
